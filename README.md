Reccommendations: From the analysis we can conclude, that:

the retention rate should be improved in order to drive more sales and improve the customer success,
the version of the product available on touch devices needs further analysis- from the time spend on different devices it seems that its desktop version is more cofortable to use,
the marketing investments should focus on the sources which give the high conversion rate, LTV and ROI values (1,2,9) and shift away from the least profitable ones (3).
